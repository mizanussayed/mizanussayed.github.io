# Portfolio (React + Tailwind)

This branch (`react-tailwind`) contains a React + Vite scaffold that uses Tailwind CSS and your existing assets in `assets/`.

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd D:\profile
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- Tailwind will be processed by PostCSS. If `npm install` fails, make sure Node.js is installed.
- Vendor CSS from the original site is still imported in `src/index.css` so the original look remains; you can gradually migrate styles to Tailwind.
